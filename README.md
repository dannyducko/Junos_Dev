# Junos Dev Automation Testing/ Learning in Python

You'll find here, a bunch of randomly put together in an absolutely random fashion, python scripts around my learnings of Junos DevOps.

Feel free to, at your own loss, pull my poorly put together scripts and have fun.

Note: Personal lab is based on eveNG with 2 vSRX bridged to my personal network. From my personal network, I then run my scripts here.
